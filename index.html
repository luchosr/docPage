            <p>Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.</p>

            <p>Solidity was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p>
            <p>Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.</p>
            <p>With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.</p>
            <p>When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. This is because breaking changes as well as new features and bug fixes are introduced regularly. We currently use a 0.x version number [to indicate this fast pace of change](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).</p>

            <h3>Language Documentation</h3>
            <p>If you are new to the concept of smart contracts we recommend you start with an example smart contract written in Solidity. When you are ready for more detail, we recommend you read the “Solidity by Example” and “Solidity in Depth” sections to learn the core concepts of the language.

                </p>
            <p>For further reading, try the basics of blockchains and details of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

                </p>
            <p>You can always try out code examples in your browser with the Remix IDE. Remix is a web browser based IDE that allows you to write Solidity smart contracts, then deploy and run the smart contracts. It can take a while to load, so please be patient.

                </p>
            <p>As humans write software, it can have bugs. You should follow established software development best-practices when writing your smart contracts, this includes code review, testing, audits, and correctness proofs. Smart contract users are sometimes more confident with code than their authors, and blockchains and smart contracts have their own unique issues to watch out for, so before working on production code, make sure you read the Security Considerations section.

                </p>
            <p>If you have any questions, you can try searching for answers or asking on the Ethereum Stackexchange, or our gitter channel.

            <h3>A Simple Smart Contract </h3>
            <p> Let us begin with a basic example that sets the value of a variable and exposes it for other contracts to access. It is fine if you do not understand everything right now, we will go into more detail later.</p>


            <h3>Storage</h3>

            <code>
                <pre>
                        pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.6.0;

                        contract SimpleStorage {
                            uint storedData;
                        
                            function set(uint x) public {
                                storedData = x;
                            }
                        
                            function get() public view returns (uint) {
                                return storedData;
                            }
                        }
                </pre>
                    
            </code>
                <p>The first line simply tells that the source code is written for Solidity version 0.4.0 or anything newer that does not break functionality (up to, but not including, version 0.6.0). This is to ensure that the contract is not compilable with a new (breaking) compiler version, where it could behave differently. So-called pragmas are common instructions for compilers about how to treat the source code (e.g. pragma once).</p>
                <p>A contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. The line uint storedData; declares a state variable called storedData of type uint (unsigned integer of 256 bits). You can think of it as a single slot in a database that can be queried and altered by calling functions of the code that manages the database. In the case of Ethereum, this is always the owning contract. And in this case, the functions set and get can be used to modify or retrieve the value of the variable.</p>
                <p>To access a state variable, you do not need the prefix this. as is common in other languages.</p>
                <p>This contract does not do much yet apart from (due to the infrastructure built by Ethereum) allowing anyone to store a single number that is accessible by anyone in the world without a (feasible) way to prevent you from publishing this number. Of course, anyone could just call set again with a different value and overwrite your number, but the number will still be stored in the history of the blockchain. Later, we will see how you can impose access restrictions so that only you can alter the number.</p>
                <p class="main-section-note">All identifiers (contract names, function names and variable names) are restricted to the ASCII character set. It is possible to store UTF-8 encoded data in string variables.</p>
                <p class="main-section-warning">Be careful with using Unicode text, as similar looking (or even identical) characters can have different code points and as such will be encoded as a different byte array.</p>
                <h3>Subcurrency Example</h3>
                <p>The following contract will implement the simplest form of a cryptocurrency. It is possible to generate coins out of thin air, but only the person that created the contract will be able to do that (it is easy to implement a different issuance scheme). Furthermore, anyone can send coins to each other without a need for registering with username and password — all you need is an Ethereum keypair.</p>

                <code>
                    <pre>
                            pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

                            contract Coin {
                                // The keyword "public" makes those variables
                                // easily readable from outside.
                                address public minter;
                                mapping (address => uint) public balances;
                            
                                // Events allow light clients to react to
                                // changes efficiently.
                                event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);
                            
                                // This is the constructor whose code is
                                // run only when the contract is created.
                                constructor() public {
                                    minter = msg.sender;
                                }
                            
                                function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
                                    require(msg.sender == minter);
                                    require(amount < 1e60);
                                    balances[receiver] += amount;
                                }
                            
                                function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
                                    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance.");
                                    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
                                    balances[receiver] += amount;
                                    emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount);
                                }
                            }
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>This contract introduces some new concepts, let us go through them one by one.</p>

                <p>The line address public minter; declares a state variable of type address that is publicly accessible. The address type is a 160-bit value that does not allow any arithmetic operations. It is suitable for storing addresses of contracts or of keypairs belonging to external persons. The keyword public automatically generates a function that allows you to access the current value of the state variable from outside of the contract. Without this keyword, other contracts have no way to access the variable. The code of the function generated by the compiler is roughly equivalent to the following (ignore external and view for now):</p>

                    <code>
                        <pre>
                                function minter() external view returns (address) { return minter; }

                        </pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>Of course, adding a function exactly like that will not work because we would have a function and a state variable with the same name, but hopefully, you get the idea - the compiler figures that out for you.

                        </p>
                    <p>The next line, mapping (address => uint) public balances; also creates a public state variable, but it is a more complex datatype. The type maps addresses to unsigned integers. Mappings can be seen as hash tables which are virtually initialized such that every possible key exists from the start and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros. This analogy does not go too far, though, as it is neither possible to obtain a list of all keys of a mapping, nor a list of all values. So either keep in mind (or better, keep a list or use a more advanced data type) what you added to the mapping or use it in a context where this is not needed. The getter function created by the public keyword is a bit more complex in this case. It roughly looks like the following:

                        </p>

                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                    function balances(address _account) external view returns (uint) {
                                        return balances[_account];
                                    }
                            </pre>
                        </code>

                    <p>As you see, you can use this function to easily query the balance of a single account.</p>
                    <p>The line event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount); declares a so-called “event” which is emitted in the last line of the function send. User interfaces (as well as server applications of course) can listen for those events being emitted on the blockchain without much cost. As soon as it is emitted, the listener will also receive the arguments from, to and amount, which makes it easy to track transactions. In order to listen for this event, you would use the following JavaScript code (which assumes that Coin is a contract object created via web3.js or a similar module):

                        </p>

                            <code>
                                <pre>
                                        Coin.Sent().watch({}, '', function(error, result) {
                                            if (!error) {
                                                console.log("Coin transfer: " + result.args.amount +
                                                    " coins were sent from " + result.args.from +
                                                    " to " + result.args.to + ".");
                                                console.log("Balances now:\n" +
                                                    "Sender: " + Coin.balances.call(result.args.from) +
                                                    "Receiver: " + Coin.balances.call(result.args.to));
                                            }
                                        })
                                        
                                </pre>
                            </code>

                            <p>
                                    Note how the automatically generated function balances is called from the user interface.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The constructor is a special function which is run during creation of the contract and cannot be called afterwards. It permanently stores the address of the person creating the contract: msg (together with tx and block) is a special global variable that contains some properties which allow access to the blockchain. msg.sender is always the address where the current (external) function call came from.


                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Finally, the functions that will actually end up with the contract and can be called by users and contracts alike are mint and send. If mint is called by anyone except the account that created the contract, nothing will happen. This is ensured by the special function require which causes all changes to be reverted if its argument evaluates to false. The second call to require ensures that there will not be too many coins, which could cause overflow errors later.


                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    On the other hand, send can be used by anyone (who already has some of these coins) to send coins to anyone else. If you do not have enough coins to send, the require call will fail and also provide the user with an appropriate error message string.


                            </p>
                            <p class="main-section-note">If you use this contract to send coins to an address, you will not see anything when you look at that address on a blockchain explorer, because the fact that you sent coins and the changed balances are only stored in the data storage of this particular coin contract. By the use of events it is relatively easy to create a “blockchain explorer” that tracks transactions and balances of your new coin, but you have to inspect the coin contract address and not the addresses of the coin owners. </p>
